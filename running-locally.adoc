[[rhmap]]
RHMAP
~~~~~

The demo solution currently requires an instance of RHMAP and will not work properly without it. It can be a local or remote instance of RHMAP, but must be configured as outlined in the Raincatcher link:getting-started.adoc[Getting Started Guide]. This allows the local *raincatcher-demo-cloud* app to access

- Forms
- Themes
- Drag & Drop App Config


[[mongodb]]
MongoDB
^^^^^^^

The *raincatcher-demo-cloud* app and *raincatcher-demo-auth* app requires a running MongoDB instance. See the link:https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/[MongoDB Installation Guide] for details on how to install MongoDB.

[[redis]]
Redis
^^^^^

The *raincatcher-demo-cloud* app requires a running instance of Redis. See the link:https://redis.io/topics/quickstart[Redis Quick Start Guide] for details on how to insall Redis manually, or use your system's package manager.

[[ruby-optional]]
Ruby
^^^^

The link:https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-cli[Raincatcher CLI Tool] is a useful tool for getting set up with all of the Raincatcher modules and Demo Apps. Follow the steps in the README file to get set up for local development.

In order to use the link:https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-cli[Raincatcher CLI Tool] to manage starting all of the demo apps, you will need to install link:https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/[Ruby]

[[install-raincatcher-cli-and-clone]]
Install Raincatcher CLI & Clone Repositories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *raincatcher-appforms* module requires that the containing cloud app has access to a running RHMAP MBaaS. This allows the local *raincatcher-demo-cloud* app to access The link:https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-cli[Raincatcher CLI Tool] is a useful tool for getting set up with all of the Raincatcher modules and Demo Apps. Follow the steps in the README to clone, install, and link all of the Raincatcher modules.

Configure Environment Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to communicate with RHMAP and the local authentication service, several environment variables need to be configured. You can find the values in RHMAP -> Projects -> _Project name given in step 2 of link:getting-started.adoc[Getting Started Guide] -> WFM Demo Cloud App -> Environment Variables -> System Environment Variables. Simply just select all envirnonment variables starting right after FH_AMQP until the end excluding LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Copy this selection into a new file ending with *.env*. Then issue following commands:

[source,bash]
----
sed 's/\s/=/g' -i <your_file.env>
sed 's/\\//g' -i <your_file.env>
----

Then include your properties file into raincatcher-demo-cloud/Gruntfile.js (around line 50):

[source,javascript]
----
    env: {
      options: {},
      local: {
        src: '<your_file.env>',
        FH_SERVICE_MAP: function(){
          var serviceMap = {
            //You can find this value in your_file.env
            '<WFM_AUTH_GUID>': 'http://localhost:8002'
          }
          return JSON.stringify(serviceMap);
        }
      }
    }
